"""Script to generate a .txt file containing student activities flags based on related course enrollment.

https://github.com/Philip-Greyson/D118-PS-Athletics-Activities-Flags

Finds all students in PS, then searches for the activities and athletics courses for each student.
If they are enrolled in a class, that activity is marked as a 1. Their activities are exported to a .txt file with one student per line.
That file is then uploaded via SFTP to a local server for AutoComm import into PS later.

Needs pysftp: pip install pysftp --upgrade
Needs oracledb: pip install oracledb --upgrade
